<!-- text about myself -->

<tab> As a sophomore Computer Science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I have attended a myriad of courses involving the nature of 
computers and programming. While comprehending the relationship between software and hardware has value, understanding design and applying 
aesthetics to provide an overall better experience to the user balances the necessities of the content and the requirements of presentation. My
interest in the design of applications derives from my desire to create, and I would like to continue studying the relationship between
user and experience as my career progresses. While this task may be achieved in various formats, from gaming to data visualization, I would prefer to apply my knowledge in the science of education or well-being. While continuously learning about the process of design and its relation to the user, I can direct my education towards assisting others through technology. Merely posing as an introduction to the world of 
Human-Computer Interaction, this course provided the opportunity to engage more heavily in the perspective of the consumer rather the mindset 
of the creator. Over several weeks, various groups and I have constructed several projects by evaluating our demographic and designing the ideal product. Five of these projects are available below as a review of the work I have done over the past few weeks.
