<!-- text about myself -->

<tab> As a sophomore Computer Science major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I have attended a myriad of courses involving the nature of 
computers and programming. While comprehending the relationship between software and hardware has value, understanding design and applying 
aesthetics to provide an overall better experience to the user balances the necessities of the backend and the requirements of design. 
Through Human-Computer Interaction I discovered the importance of knowing the user and what they desire in their products. The importance of color and data visualization repeatedly presented itself during this course. Over several weeks, various groups and I have constructed several projects by evaluating our demographic and designing the ideal product. Four of these projects are available below as a review of the work I have done over the past few weeks.
